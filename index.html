          <pre id="typewriter" class="typewriter">We met online in 2022, in the most unexpected way, while playing Minecraft.
What started as a simple game slowly turned into late-night conversations, laughter, comfort, and a connection I never planned but instantly cherished.

In 2022, friendship turned into love.
And even though there was distance between us, our hearts never felt far apart.

Three years later, on November 27, 2025, the moment we had waited for finally came — we met in real life.
From pixels to reality, from screens to smiles, everything felt surreal and perfect, like our story was always meant to happen.

You are my safe place, my happiness, and my favorite person.
Thank you for choosing me every day, for loving me the way you do, and for being my constant through every level of life.

On your birthday, I just want you to know this:
No matter where life takes us, no matter how many chapters are still unwritten, I will always be right beside you — loving you, supporting you, and growing with you.

Happy Birthday, my love ❤️
From a game that brought us together to a life we are building together — forever us.</pre>
